# Forecasting Daily Traffic Data with Purely Statistical Models

## Overview

This repository contains code for forecasting daily traffic data using purely statistical models. The project utilizes the PEMS dataset for traffic monitoring and implements various statistical models to predict traffic patterns.

## Files

- **data_analysis.py**: Contains functions for analyzing and preprocessing the dataset.
- **logger.py**: Provides logging functionalities for the project.
- **main.py**: Main script for running the forecasting models.
- **metrics.py**: Implements evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the models.
- **preprocessor.py**: Handles preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature engineering.
- **statistical_models.py**: Includes implementations of various statistical forecasting models.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions used across the project.
- **visualizer.py**: Provides visualization capabilities for analyzing the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the PEMS (PeMS) dataset, which is commonly used for traffic monitoring and analysis. It contains daily traffic data that can be used for forecasting purposes.

## Usage

To run the forecasting models, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Forecasting-Daily-Trafic-data-with-purely-Statistical-Models.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Forecasting-Daily-Trafic-data-with-purely-Statistical-Models
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
